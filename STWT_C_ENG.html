                In this round, the Top 10 Games will go through a round of Cost Per Install (CPI) & Retention testing. The test will be conducted in the US Market. Depending on the test results, they will have the opportunity to win the following prizes such as:
            </p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:decimal;font-family: MontReg">
                <li class="pl-3">
                    The first Game submission that gets published by Storms as part of the contest will win US$100,000.
                </li>
                <li class="pl-3">
                    All other Game submissions that get published by Storms as part of the contest other than the first Game will win US$50,000.

                <li class="pl-3">
                    In addition, we will be giving out bonus prizes for other Games which have performed well in the UA tests.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="mt-4">
                The KPIs for global launch include: CPI
                < $0.25, D1 Retention> 50%, D7 Retention > 10%, and Playtime > 750s.
            </h5>
            <p class="mt-4">
                Having said this, there are many factors that go into the decision to globally launch a game, and Storms takes a holistic view of every game we evaluate, and some games may qualify for publishing if some of their KPIs fall short of the target while others
                outperform them.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">
                Please note that in order to be entitled to any prizes mentioned herein, you must participate in media and other publicity events and engagements in connection with the Contest and sign a publishing agreement with Storms Publishing (“Publishing Contract”).
                Each participant whose submission is selected for publishing shall sign a Publishing Contract and if the game is successfully launched will receive the prize money as a minimum guarantee payment under the Publishing Contract. The winner
                will receive the payment upon acceptance of the game under the Publishing Contract and the prize amount received by the winner shall be recoupable from royalties as defined in the Publishing Contract.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">
                For the avoidance of doubt, Storms retain the discretion whether to declare winners, and if so, up to a maximum of ten..
